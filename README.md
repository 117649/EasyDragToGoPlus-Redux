Please read the tips.

## Tips ##
* :warning: If using Waterfox and/or bootstrapLoader the browser __must__ be restarted after installation!
  * (If using userChromeJS the startup cache may need to be cleared between updates.)
* If you don't want the waring sign under the addon card in 'about:addons' add a bool preference to your 'about:config' named `extensions.easydragtogo.hide_warning` and set it to `true`. Then it should gone after a restart. If it come back again restart again.
